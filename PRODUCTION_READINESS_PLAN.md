# AJ-HCP-LE Production Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

The AJ-HCP-LE electrical contracting field service management system is currently at **80-85% production readiness**. This comprehensive plan outlines the critical path to full production deployment, prioritizing tasks by business impact and technical risk.

**Current Status:**
- Strong technical foundation with React 19/TypeScript frontend and Django 4.2 backend
- Core functionality operational (customer management, job tracking, billing)
- Security infrastructure in place but needs enhancement
- Testing coverage at 80%+ but missing critical E2E tests
- Mobile app in early development stage
- Deployment ready for Railway/Vercel but needs production hardening

**Critical Path to Production:** 4-6 weeks with focused effort
