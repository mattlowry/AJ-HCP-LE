- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Enable gzip compression

## üìà Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-deployment Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:lighthouse

# Build and test production bundle
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### 2. Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to chosen platform
# For Vercel:
vercel deploy --prod

# For Railway:
railway up
```

### 3. Post-deployment Verification
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify error boundaries work correctly
- [ ] Check monitoring data is being received
- [ ] Test performance metrics collection
